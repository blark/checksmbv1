# checksmbv1

A Python script to check if SMBv1 is enabled on a remote host.

## Install

The script uses [Impacket](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket) to negotiate the SMBv1 connection, and the click module for command line options and colour output.

To install requirements run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

There's not much to it at this point... just run:

`checksmbv1 <ip>`
